 --> MikMod Sound Libraries Version 3.1.8
 --> libmikmod 3.1.8 was released on 10/25/1999.

This version of the library is based on the official UNIX MikMod
library version 3.1.8, found at:  http://mikmod.darkorb.net/

It has been stripped down for inclusion with Simple DirectMedia Layer,
but the missing drivers and file loaders can be plugged right in from
the MikMod 3.1.8 archive.
