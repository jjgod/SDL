 --> MikMod Sound Libraries Version 3.0
  -> Release Notes - August 20th, 1997

-- 
This version of the library is based on the official UNIX MikMod version 3.0,
found at:  http://freenet.tlh.fl.us/~amstpi/mikmod.html

It has been stripped down for inclusion with Simple DirectMedia Layer, 
but the missing drivers and file loaders can be plugged right in from
the MikMod 3.03 archive.
