mixer 1.0

Due to popular demand, here is a simple multi-channel audio mixer.
It supports 4 channels of 16 bit stereo audio, plus a single channel
of music, mixed by the popular MikMod MOD, Timidity MIDI and SMPEG MP3
libraries.

See the header file mixer.h and the examples playwave.c and playmus.c
for documentation on this mixer library.

The mixer can currently load Microsoft WAVE files as audio samples
and can load MIDI files via Timidity and the following music formats
via MikMod:  .MOD .S3M .IT .XM. It can also load MP3 music using the
SMPEG library.

The process of mixing MIDI files to wave output is very CPU intensive,
so if playing regular WAVE files sound great, but playing MIDI files
sound choppy, try using 8-bit audio, mono audio, or lower frequencies.

To play MIDI files, you'll need to get a complete set of GUS patches
from:  http://www.devolution.com/~slouken/SDL/timidity/timidity.tar.gz
and unpack them in /usr/local/lib under UNIX, and C:\ under Win32.

You may add panning, reverb, echo, whatever, but if you do, please
mail changes back to me, Sam Lantinga at slouken@devolution.com
