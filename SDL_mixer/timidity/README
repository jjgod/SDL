        This is the README file for TiMidity v0.2i

	TiMidity is a MIDI to WAVE converter that uses Gravis
Ultrasound(*)-compatible patch files to generate digital audio data
from General MIDI files. The audio data can be played through any
sound device or stored on disk. On a fast machine, music can be
played in real time. TiMidity runs under Linux, FreeBSD, HP-UX, SunOS, and
Win32, and porting to other systems with gcc should be easy.

	TiMidity Features:

	* 32 or more dynamically allocated fully independent voices
	* Compatibility with GUS patch files
	* Output to 16- or 8-bit PCM or uLaw audio device, file, or
          stdout at any sampling rate
	* Optional interactive mode with real-time status display
	  under ncurses and SLang terminal control libraries. Also
          a user friendly motif interface since version 0.2h
	* Support for transparent loading of compressed MIDI files and
	  patch files

	* Support for the following MIDI events:
	  - Program change
	  - Key pressure
	  - Channel main volume
	  - Tempo
	  - Panning
	  - Damper pedal (Sustain)
	  - Pitch wheel
	  - Pitch wheel sensitivity
	  - Change drum set

* The GNU General Public License can, as always, be found in the file
  "../COPYING".

* TiMidity requires sampled instruments (patches) to play MIDI files. You
  should get the file "timidity-lib-0.1.tar.gz" and unpack it in the same
  directory where you unpacked the source code archive. You'll want more
  patches later -- read the file "FAQ" for pointers.

* Timidity is no longer supported, but can be found by searching the web.
