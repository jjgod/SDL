Add color modulation to blitting
Blit convert format X -> format Y (needed for texture upload)
Blit copy / blend / modulate format X -> format X (needed for software renderer)

Create full software renderer for framebuffer interfaces.

Create texture for surface, keep surface around as pixel source, allow
copying / blending / modulating from surface to display (automatically
generate texture?)

At that point, should anyone be using anything besides textures for display?
