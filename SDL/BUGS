All:
	Audio rate conversion is only implemented by multiplying or dividing
	by a power of two.  This is a side-effect of the requirement that the
	raw audio buffer size be a power of two, and can hopefully be fixed.
	This means 8 KHz audio converted to 22 KHz ends up being 16 KHz. :-/

	When the implementation is writing directly to video memory the mouse
	cursor doesn't work properly.  Applications which do this should use
	their own mouse cursor and call SDL_ShowCursor(0) to hide the system
	cursor.

Linux:
	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

	The AAlib, GGI, and SVGAlib video drivers are not heavily tested.

Win32:
	The MCI driver can't tell if the CD-ROM drive is paused or stopped.

	The SDL_INIT_EVENTTHREAD flag is not supported on Win32
	(Idea: create a separate DirectInput polling thread)
	The main purpose of this flag is for smooth cursor motion in
	fullscreen environments.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	This requires the ToUnicode() API which is only implemented on
	Windows NT/2000, not on Windows 95/98.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

	Joysticks are only supported under the Win32 MultiMedia API,
	DirectInput support is not yet implemented.

BeOS:
	BePPC is not supported, apparently not even by Be Inc.

	SDL_WM_GrabInput() is not implemented.
	Does anyone know how to do this?  SDL_WM_GrabInput() is designed
	to prevent the user from switching input and mouse focus away from
	the SDL application.

	Continuous relative mouse motion is not implemented.

	The CD driver doesn't detect SCSI CD-ROMs yet.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) has not been tested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

MacOS:
	Palette handling isn't implemented in windowed mode yet.

	Audio hasn't been extensively tested, in particular the locking
	isn't implemented and mixer routines may not call malloc() or free()
	because they are called at interrupt time.

	SDL_WM_GrabInput() is not implemented.
	Does anyone know how to do this?  SDL_WM_GrabInput() is designed
	to prevent the user from switching input and mouse focus away from
	the SDL application.

	Continuous relative mouse motion is not implemented.

	SDL_AddTimer() and SDL_RemoveTimer() haven't been implemented yet.

	Not all of the keys are properly recognized on the keyboard.

MacOS X:
	Fullscreen mode doesn't work - it requires the QuickTime framework
	and that the new SDL window gets raised to the top of the Z order.

	Palette handling isn't implemented in windowed mode yet.

	Native sound and video routines are not finished, though Carbon
	seems to work fairly well.

	Joysticks and CD-ROM functions are not implemented yet.

	SDL_WM_GrabInput() is not implemented.
	Does anyone know how to do this?  SDL_WM_GrabInput() is designed
	to prevent the user from switching input and mouse focus away from
	the SDL application.

	Continuous relative mouse motion is not implemented.

	Not all of the keys are properly recognized on the keyboard.

	MacOS X seems to have a broken pthread_cancel() implementation.

FreeBSD:
	pthread_cancel() isn't supported by FreeBSD 3.X, so threads don't
	work on versions of FreeBSD earlier than 4.0.

	The CD-ROM handling doesn't work completely.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

Solaris:
	The joystick functions are not implemented yet.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

IRIX:
	The CD-ROM handling doesn't work completely.

	The joystick functions are not implemented yet.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

OpenBSD:  -= NOT YET SUPPORTED =-
	This is reported to work, but I haven't verified this.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

OSF/Tru64:  -= NOT YET SUPPORTED =-
	The audio functions are not implemented yet.

	Joysticks and CD-ROM functions are not implemented yet.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

AIX:  -= NOT YET SUPPORTED =-
	This port has only been tested with AIX 4.3.3

	The OpenGL support doesn't work yet.

	The joystick subsystem isn't implemented yet.

	Endian detection doesn't work yet - needs a unique CPP symbol.

	Wide UNICODE character input (Kanji, etc.) is not yet supported.
	It requires handling of keyboard mapping events and using the XIM
	input translation extension.  I will implement it as requested.
	Latin-1 keyboard input works fine.

	The AIX port was done by Carsten.Griwodz@KOM.tu-darmstadt.de
	More information on this port is available at:
	http://www.kom.e-technik.tu-darmstadt.de/~griff/SDL/

QNX:  -= NOT YET SUPPORTED =-
	Configuration doesn't work right, Makefiles still need to be
	tweaked (need to add libraries to any apps that use sdl_config
	to figure out what libs they need).
 
	Only static libraries are being made, no shared ones.
 
	The only hardware surface is the primary view surface.
 
	Mouse events don't seem to be working right.
 
	Fullscreen doesn't display correctly.
 
	The software surfaces could use some speed up.
 
	Many of the test apps segment violate on exit, and I'm not sure
	they're all working either
 
	It doesn't look like the OpenGL stuff is there. (did a grep for
	PdCreateOpenGLContext, nothing found).
 
	The mouse cursor doesn't look right.

AmigaOS:  -= NOT YET SUPPORTED =-
	The OpenGL support isn't implemented yet.

	SDL_WM_GrabInput() is not implemented.
	Does anyone know how to do this?  SDL_WM_GrabInput() is designed
	to prevent the user from switching input and mouse focus away from
	the SDL application.

	Continuous relative mouse motion is not implemented.

	Audio can work, but isn't completely integrated in the CVS
	version of SDL.

	The joystick subsystem isn't implemented yet.

	There's some confusion about the multi-threaded synchronization
	primitives on AmigaOS, so mutexes and semaphores aren't correctly
	implemented yet.

	The AmigaOS port was done by Gabriele.Greco@galactica.it
