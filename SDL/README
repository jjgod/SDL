This is the Simple DirectMedia Layer, a generic API that provides low
level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, 3D hardware via OpenGL,
and 2D framebuffer across multiple platforms.

SDL is written in C, but works with C++ natively, and has bindings to
several other languages, including Ada, Eiffel, ML, Perl, and Python. 

The current version supports Linux, Windows, BeOS, MacOS, MacOS X,
FreeBSD, BSD/OS, Solaris, and IRIX.  The code contains support for
Windows CE, OpenBSD, NetBSD, AIX, OSF/Tru64, and QNX, but these are
not yet officially supported.

This library is distributed under GNU LGPL version 2, which can be
found in the file  "COPYING".  This license allows you to use SDL
freely in commercial programs as long as you link with the dynamic
library.

The best way to learn how to use SDL is to check out the header files in
the "include" subdirectory and the programs in the "test" subdirectory.
The header files and test programs are well commented and always up to date.
More documentation is available in HTML format in "./docs/index.html"

The test programs in the "test" subdirectory are in the public domain.
